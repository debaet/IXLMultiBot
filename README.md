# Why is this important?
This is important, because this is one of the first functional IXL bot(s).

# Features
* scrape questions and answers 
* ~~generate teacher accounts~~ Feature not added.
* inflate your time! (get over 10 hours w/o doing anything)
* auto answer!

# What It Uses
* Latest version of Python
* Selenium (python) [install by using pip install selenium]

##### Selenium is a browser automation library for Python.
# Installation

1. First of all make sure you have the latest version of Python installed, if you don't, google how to download it.

2. Start of by going onto https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
* Download Chromedriver depending on your chrome version.
* Next,  download the file, next edit it with any text editor. 
* now go the PATH variable or line 16. now find the directory for your webdriver and edit there. 

3. Open up CMD, and do pip install selenium.
4. Also, after selenium finishes installing, enter the following commands:
* pip install colorama
* pip install Faker

i believe that is all.

# Is this malicous?
No. It's open source, and will never contain a virus unless I sneak it in, and this is a utility, so why would I do that?
# What works?
* For now, options 1 and 2.
* 3 has not been added yet.
* Same with the scraper, it only works with some questions until i add new Xpaths but i am too tired to do it today, so it expect it in a couple days.

# INFO
this code uses over 300 lines of code and was coded in all one day, so please expect some errors along the way.
If you want to report errors, DM on reddit or on IG, or if you  know python yourself, leave a pull request.
